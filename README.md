## Features
The Unit Converter offers the following key features:

1. **Multiple Conversion Options:** The program supports a wide range of unit conversions, including length, weight, temperature, volume, and more. Users can select the desired conversion type from a menu.

2. **Interactive User Interface:** The converter provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to input values and view the converted results easily.

3. **Error Handling:** The program includes robust error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes and ensure smooth operation. It validates user inputs, detects invalid conversions, and displays appropriate error messages.

4. **Flexible Customization:** The converter allows users to customize the program by adding new units or modifying existing conversions. This ensures the program remains adaptable to specific requirements.

## Prerequisites
To run the Unit Converter program, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** The JDK must be installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Oracle website.

2. **Java IDE:** You will need a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans to compile and run the program.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Unit Converter:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unit-converter.git
```

2. **Import Project:** Open your preferred Java IDE and import the project from the cloned repository.

3. **Compile and Run:** Compile the Java source files and run the main program file to launch the Unit Converter.

## Usage
Once the Unit Converter is running, follow these steps to perform a conversion:

1. **Select Conversion Type:** Choose the type of conversion you want to perform from the available options presented in the menu.

2. **Enter Input Value:** Enter the value you want to convert when prompted. Ensure the input value is numeric and within the valid range.

3. **View Conversion Result:** The program will display the converted value based on the selected conversion type.

4. **Repeat or Exit:** You can repeat the conversion process by selecting another conversion type or exit the program.

## Adding Custom Units
To add custom units or modify existing conversions, follow these steps:

1. **Locate Conversion Configuration:** Open the project in your Java IDE and navigate to the "ConversionConfig.java" file.

2. **Add or Modify Conversion:** Inside the file, you will find conversion configurations for different unit types. Add new units or modify existing conversions by following the existing format.

3. **Recompile and Run:** After making the changes, recompile the program and run it to apply the custom unit configurations.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while running the program, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have the required Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and properly configured.

2. **Check Input Values:** Make sure you enter valid numeric values within the acceptable range for conversions.

3. **Review Error Messages:** Pay attention to any error messages displayed by the program. They may provide insights into the problem.

4. **Debugging:** Use the debugging capabilities of your Java IDE to step through the code and identify potential issues.
